### COMMENTS FOR GRADER- So i initially had my index.html on the root level of my repository and my style.css and script.js inside of a folder called "develop". When i deployed my application though using github pages it wasnt applying my javascript or css to the html. I tried a few things and the only solution was to move all 3 outside of the developer folder to the root level of my repository. I didnt do anything differently from my last homework repositories so im assuming the problem was the javascript file somehow. Please let me know what caused this issue so i dont get points deducted for not following best file structure practices on the next assignment! thank you :)
